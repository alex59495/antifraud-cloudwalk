# Get your hands dirty

## 1. Analyze the data provided and present your conclusions (consider that all transactions are made using a mobile device).

  - Some users seems to pay with different credit card at some very close moments => Could be the sign of a fraud. Is there any verification done between the cardholder, the card number and the datetime the transaction is done in te fraud process ?
  - The device_id is empty for some rows, is it part of the fraud verification process ?
  - Some merchants seems to have a lot of chargebacks for relatively high amounts coming from the same devises/user => Is there a method linking the devise/user with the merchant and the fact that they are already chargebacks existing between them in the fraud verification system ?
This could be either a fraud coming from the merchant itself or from the user doing _intentional friendly fraud_
  - Some card_number seems to have different format (1-2 digit less / 1 digit more), is it normal in the process that those formats are passing ?
  

## 2. In addition to the spreadsheet data, what other data would you look at to try to find patterns of possible frauds?
- Addtional information about the payments habits of the user (average amount, what is the "object" of transacations etc..)
- Chargeback rates of the user (if the chargeback rate is high it could show an _intentional friendly fraud_ habit)
- User's geolocalisation when the transaction is made (possibly compare with known address etc..)
- Additional information about the transaction itself, who is the seller, what is the delivery address etc..
- Addtional information about the merchant (chargeback rates, average transaction amount etc..)
- Additional information about the chargeback => What was the cause ?
